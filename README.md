# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of the analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

For this task I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

The stages of the machine learning process I went through as part of this analysis are:

Preprocess: This step consists of cleaning the data and splitting it into
subsets for training and testing the model.

Train: I used a large subset of our labeled data to teach the model to recognize classification patterns.

Validation: I used a small subset of the labelled data to test how well the model is able to predict labels.

Prediction: I used the data to predict labels.

The Logistic Regression Model used in this analysis  predict the healthy loan and high-risk loan labels with a high percentage score in accuracy, Precision and recall.

In conclusion I recommend to use the Logistic Regression Model as it aim for high precision and high recall value.
